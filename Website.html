                I'm a recent Kennesaw State University Graduate with a bachelor of science in computer engineering.<br>
                I made this website as a personal project to learn how HTML, CSS, and JS works and understand<br>
                how websites are developed. I am hopeful that the skills that I acquire throughout this journey <br>
                will not only make me a better programmer but also enable me to be of better use to others. If you<br>
                would like to learn more about me feel free to explore the tabs above to inquire more information<br>
                about me.
