            <p>
                I'm a recent Kennesaw State University Graduate with a bachelor of science in computer engineering.
                I made this website as a personal project to learn how HTML, CSS, and JS works and understand
                how websites are developed. I am hopeful that the skills that I acquire throughout this journey 
                will not only make me a beter programmer but also enable me to be of better use to others. If you
                would like to learn more about me feel free to explore the tabs above to inquire more information
                about me.
